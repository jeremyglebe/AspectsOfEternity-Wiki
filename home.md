## The Cataclysm and the Fall of the Gods
The story of Aspects of Eternity begins on the long-forgotten planet of Elysys, the cradle of human and demi-human civilizations. A devastating cataclysm struck the world when the moon collapsed, revealing an ancient presence just beneath the surface. This being would emerge and lay waste to the once-thriving civilizations, opening portals into the dark Abyss and felling gods with a whisper. Then, as soon as it had appeared, the presence was gone from this realm. The gods, immortal and mighty, were stripped of their Aspects of Eternity, becoming mortal and vulnerable. As the Aspects vanished, so too did their ability to traverse the godly realms.

## The God-King's Exodus and the War Among the Stars
The newly mortal gods fought a bitter war against both each other and the abyssal creatures. Many of the "Order" pantheon fell. God-King Aurias and his apprentice, the White Flame Etehr, fought side-by-side in this struggle. \[[This story is expanded in the wiki secrets.](/secrets#who-is-the-god-king)\]

Recognizing the hopeless state of Elysys, the God-King led a grand exodus, taking humanity and its demi-human brethren to the stars. With the aid of dwarven forges, gnomish engineering, elven magicks, and the combined efforts of humans and halflings, they built a colossal space station, Havenstar, to serve as their new home.

For 50,000 years, humanity battled against alien forces known as the "Other," but victory remained elusive. As the war raged, the God-King aged and eventually perished, leaving his people with one final command: "Return to Elysys. In the skies of the old world thou shalt find the Aspects. My people shall claim Eternity once more and resurrect this withered body... Then shall the light of Humanity shine once more..."

## The Return to Elysys and the Rise of Harbor
Scattered and leaderless, humanity sought to find their lost homeworld of Elysys. After countless sacrifices and hardships, they finally returned to the now-feral and hostile planet. Led by the last remaining six Lords Eternal, the remnants of humanity founded a great city called Harbor. It would become a bastion of hope in a brutal world, contending with the planet's evolved flora and fauna, as well as the demonic forces that still roamed the land.

## The Overdark Station - A Relic from the Stars
Above Elysys loomed the Overdark Station, a massive alien vessel of unknown origin. Its inhabitants long gone or transformed into twisted mutants, the station became humanity's primary source of advanced technology. Scavengers braved the dangers within, seeking fortune, fame, and perhaps the lost Aspects of Eternity.

## A World of Contrasts - Technology, Magic, and the Struggle for Survival
In this world of contrasts, Harbor is a melting pot of primitive structures and advanced technology. The military employs mid-level tech to defend against the planet's threats, while the Lords Eternal cling to their dwindling power suits. The people of Harbor live with a mix of ancient knowledge, scavenged alien technology, and the ever-present danger posed by the hostile environment and demonic forces.

# Adventuring

## Factions and Power Struggles
Within Harbor, various factions have emerged, each with their own goals and motivations. Some seek to strengthen the city's defenses, while others aim to uncover the secrets of the Overdark Station or find ways to restore the Aspects of Eternity. The interplay between these factions creates a complex web of alliances and rivalries, offering players a diverse range of social dynamics and conflicts to navigate.

## The Demonic Threat and the Search for the Aspects
As the demonic forces still roam Elysys, Harbor must remain vigilant against these malevolent entities. Players will encounter different types of demons, each with unique abilities and motivations, and will need to unravel the secrets of their origin in order to combat them effectively. Unbeknownst to many, some individuals or factions within Harbor may have formed secret pacts with the demons, adding further complications to the struggle.

## Rediscovering Ancient Knowledge and the Quest for Eternity
The primary goal of the people of Harbor is to find and reclaim the Aspects of Eternity, which could be hidden within the Overdark Station, scattered across Elysys, or locked away in other dimensions. Players will embark on a grand quest to uncover the lost Aspects, delving into ancient ruins, deciphering cryptic archives, and overcoming powerful guardians to achieve their objective.

## Lost Colonies and the Hope for Unity
Throughout their journey, players may encounter rumors or signals from lost human and demi-human colonies, prompting the people of Harbor to launch expeditions to find and rescue their brethren. These missions will test the players' resourcefulness and courage, as they face the unknown dangers of the cosmos in the name of unity and survival.

Aspects of Eternity offers a rich and detailed campaign setting where players will confront the challenges of a post-apocalyptic world, navigate intricate political landscapes, and ultimately, embark on a quest to restore the divine power of their fallen God-King. With its blend of technology, magic, and survival, this setting provides ample opportunities for adventure and exploration, promising a thrilling experience for both players and game masters alike.
