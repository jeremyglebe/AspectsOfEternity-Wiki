# Humanity
Humanity, with a capital 'H', refers to all human-adjacent ancestries, including the various demi-human races and the Gryms. It is a term of unity, emphasizing the shared struggles and history of these diverse races.

## Humans
Humans are the most numerous of the races, known for their adaptability and diversity. They excel in manifesting their beliefs and destiny, often leading them to become influential clergymen and religious leaders.

## Hobs
Descendants of Halflings, Hobs are about 4 feet tall and covered in hair, resembling short sasquatches. They are nimble, adaptable, and known for learning new skills rapidly.

## Fymbles
The cosmic children of elven lineage, Fymbles have translucent skin with lights dancing beneath, resembling portals to celestial bodies. They wield a powerful Empath aura that influences those around them.

## Meks (Gnismen)
Evolved from Gnomes, Meks average 5'5" in height, with rubbery flesh and slim, angled features. Their fingers are thin and precise, suited for engineering work. They are resistant to electrical currents. They are prone to being misunderstood due to their logical and concise manner of speech, which often comes across as cold or unemotional. This leads to unfair stereotypes and bigotry, with the derogatory term 'Gnob' used by those who wish to insult or belittle them.

## Jargogs (Oggs)
Bred as living siege machines, Jargogs are large, muscular, and have a single eye with layered rings around the pupil. They possess long arms for reaching enemies and see far distances, making them effective in combat.

## Dwarves
Dwarves have maintained their lineage in its purest form. Occasionally, human families give birth to 100% dwarven children. They are masters of the forge, metals, and mechanics.

## [Gryms](/ancestry/grym)
Gryms are evolved ogres, transformed by war against Delta Spores. They have stone-like skin, poisonous breath, and are agile in combat. A large portion of Gryms are sterile, leading to their gradual decline.

## Proto Vanguard
The Proto Vanguard were an attempt by the Lord of The Forge to replicate the Astral Vanguard. They are born of mutative processes that remain highly experimental, and are often unstable. They possess an incredibly wide range of abilities, and trained as warriors and academics, but constantly grapple with an extreme dependency on the mutagens which created them. Their mutations are volatile and self destructive, and no proto vanguard has ever lived past 50 years of age.

# Origins
Sometimes a character's core and innate traits are not actually defined by ancestry, but instead by events or changes that permanently impact their physiology. Categories of such characters are referred to as 'Origins'. Origins include backgrounds such as Mutants and Cyborgs.

*Origins are going to be edge-chains disconnected from the core ancestry tree. They are no longer going to be a subcategory of ancestry, but instead a restricted edge chain that some ancestries may gain immediately, or may be enabled as the plot progresses. These will be moved later.*

## Mutants
Mutants are individuals who have undergone mutation due to various causes, such as exposure to corruptive forces or the result of experimental processes like the Proto-Vanguard program. Their abilities and appearances vary widely, often reflecting the nature of the chaos beings their DNA has been spliced with. Mutants often face discrimination and fear due to their unusual appearances and powers, leading to various subcultures within the mutant population.

## [Cyborgs](/ancestry/cyborg)
Cyborgs are unique entities, a synthesis of flesh and steel, largely born from The Lord of The Forge's attempts to replicate the Astral Vanguard. Although they are often seen as tools by Corporations and Banks, they possess the unique insight and complexity of human intelligence. Despite their rarity and the suspicion they often face, Cyborgs are resilient, striving to find their place in a world that often views them with fear and mistrust.
