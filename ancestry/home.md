# Humanity
Humanity, with a capital 'H', refers to all human-adjacent ancestries, including the various demi-human races and the Ogryms. It is a term of unity, emphasizing the shared struggles and history of these diverse races.

## Humans
Humans are the most numerous of the races, adaptable and diverse. They come in all shapes, sizes, and colors, with a wide range of talents and skills.

## Hobmen (Hobs)
Hobmen, often shortened to 'Hobs', are the descendants of halflings. They are slightly shorter and rounder than typical humans, with tufts of hair growing from nearly everywhere. Hobs are agile, quick on their feet, and have an extraordinary resistance to exhaustion, hunger, and sleep deprivation.

## Feymen (Fyms)
Feymen, or 'Fyms' for short, are the descendants of elves. They retain the ethereal beauty and longevity of their ancestors, and they possess a natural affinity for magic. Feymen are often seen as aloof or distant due to their long lifespans and natural grace.

## Gnismen (Meks)
Gnismen, often referred to as 'Meks', are the descendants of gnomes. They are thin with round noses and pointy ears, bearing a natural talent for invention and mechanics. Gnismen are prone to being misunderstood due to their logical and concise manner of speech, which often comes across as cold or unemotional. This leads to unfair stereotypes and bigotry, with the derogatory term 'Gnob' used by those who wish to insult or belittle them.

## Ogmen (Oggs)
Ogmen, or 'Oggs', are the descendants of ogres. They are larger than typical humans and are known for their impressive physical strength and resilience. Ogmen have an affinity for nature and display a surprising gentleness and wisdom despite their size and strength.

## Dwarves
Dwarves, unlike other demi-human races, have managed to preserve their lineage in its purest form. Humans with dwarven ancestry occasionally give birth to 100% Dwarven children. Dwarves are shorter and sturdier than typical humans, and are renowned for their skill in craftsmanship, their hardiness, and their ability to endure both physical and magical hardships.

## [Ogryms](/ancestry/ogrym)
Ogryms are a unique offshoot of ogres, forever changed by a long war against the Delta Orx-Spore in the outer reaches of the galaxy. They are monstrous in size with stone-like skin and poisonous breath. Ogryms are slow of pace but agile and quick in combat. They are a race born of war, slowly dying out due to a large portion of them being sterile.

# Origins
Sometimes a character's core and innate traits are not actually defined by ancestry, but instead by events or changes that permanently impact their physiology. Categories of such characters are referred to as 'Origins'. Origins include backgrounds such as Mutants and Cyborgs.

## Mutants
Mutants are individuals who have undergone mutation due to various causes, such as exposure to corruptive forces or the result of experimental processes like the Proto-Vanguard program. Their abilities and appearances vary widely, often reflecting the nature of the chaos beings their DNA has been spliced with. Mutants often face discrimination and fear due to their unusual appearances and powers, leading to various subcultures within the mutant population.

## Cyborgs
Cyborgs are unique entities, a synthesis of flesh and steel, largely born from The Lord of The Forge's attempts to replicate the Astral Vanguard. They are characterized by their superior physical strength, durability, and processing capabilities, but their existence is often a struggle to maintain their sense of humanity amidst their mechanical nature. Although they are often seen as tools by Corporations and Banks, they possess the unique insight and complexity of human intelligence. Despite their rarity and the suspicion they often face, Cyborgs are resilient, striving to find their place in a world that often views them with fear and mistrust.
