# Overview

Ogryms, descendants of an ancient Ogre army, are truly monstrous in size, standing significantly larger and wider than even the mighty Ogres from which they descend. Their skin is akin to stone, their breath toxic to certain forms of life, and their eyes burn with deep reds and yellows. They are slow in pace but surprisingly agile in combat, capable of devastating physical feats.

# Playing an Ogrym

When selected as a character ancestry, Ogryms have the following traits:

## [2] Armor 2
The species has a thick hide or is encrusted in solid material like scaly plating or even rock. This grants Armor +2 each time it’s taken.

## [2] Attribute Increase (Strength)
During character creation, the species increases a particular attribute
(Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, or Vigor) one die type. This increases the Trait’s maximum
by one as well.

## [2] Attribute Increase (Vigor)
During character creation, the species increases a particular attribute
(Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, or Vigor) one die type. This increases the Trait’s maximum
by one as well.

## [1] Immune to Poison
The species is immune to poison. (And, in Ogryms case, resistant to alcohol)

## [2] Poisonous Touch (Lethal)
With a successful Touch Attack (page 108), bite, or claw, the victim
must roll Vigor or suffer the effects of Mild Poison. For 3 points the poison can be upgraded
to Knockout, Lethal, or Paralyzing instead, but each use causes the hero Fatigue. The
character may always choose whether or not to use her poison touch. See page 128 for
Poison and its effects. (NOTE: Normally costs 3, reducing because in the Ogryms' case, this only affects fungi, vines, "chaos growths", and some common plantlife)

## [2] Size +2
The creature is larger than normal. Each point of Size adds directly to Toughness and increases maximum Strength one step. Large species may have difficulty using equipment designed for more traditional humanoids. See page 106 for more on Size.

## [-2] Big
The race is particularly large in a world where most others aren’t. He subtracts 2 from Trait rolls when using equipment that wasn’t specifically designed for his race and cannot wear their armor or clothing. Equipment, food, and clothing cost double the listed price.

## [-1] Hinderance (Minor, Death Wish)
The race has an inherent Minor Hindrance for 1 point, or a Major Hindrance
for 2. This doesn’t affect the ability to choose other Hindrances during character creation.

## [-1] Hinderance (Minor, Outsider)
The race has an inherent Minor Hindrance for 1 point, or a Major Hindrance
for 2. This doesn’t affect the ability to choose other Hindrances during character creation.

## [-2] Hinderance (Major, Phobia (Fungi))
The race has an inherent Minor Hindrance for 1 point, or a Major Hindrance
for 2. This doesn’t affect the ability to choose other Hindrances during character creation.

## [-1] Hinderance (Minor, Ugly)
The race has an inherent Minor Hindrance for 1 point, or a Major Hindrance
for 2. This doesn’t affect the ability to choose other Hindrances during character creation.

## [-1] Racial Enemy (Orx):
This species dislikes another species relatively common to the setting. They suffer a –2 penalty to Persuasion rolls when dealing with their rivals and may become hostile with little provocation. This may only be taken once per race.

## [-1] Reduced Pace 1
For –1 point, reduce Pace by 1 and the running die a die type (d4 is reduced to d4–1). For –2 points, reduce Pace another 2 points and subtract 2 from Athletics and rolls to resist Athletics where movement and mobility are integral to the challenge (GM’s call).

# History

The origin of the Ogryms traces back to a crucial event in the history of the cosmos. A massive Ogre army was dispatched to the outer reaches of the galaxy with the mission to contain and combat the burgeoning plague of Delta Orx-Spore. This struggle lasted for an epic 42000-year period, a battle of attrition against an enemy that was ultimately unstoppable. 

The Ogre warriors who managed to survive this protracted conflict returned to their own kind vastly changed. Their bodies had adapted to the relentless onslaught of the spore and the harsh conditions of their mission, birthing new traits and abilities that set them apart from their original Ogre lineage. These survivors were christened as Ogryms, a new race forged in the crucible of war.

However, the fight against the spore was ultimately lost. A detachment of survivors, lost and disoriented from their intended path back to the God-Emperor's astral fortress, stumbled upon Humanity fleeing back to Eden. Here, they found a semblance of their old selves and a chance to continue their existence. They re-joined Humanity in its fight for survival, becoming a part of the collective struggle against the demons that now infest Eden. 


# Traits

Ogryms are renowned for their resilience and resistance to harsh conditions. They can endure long periods without food or water, though they are perpetually hungry when sustenance is available. They boast immunity to most poisons and alcohol, making them hardy survivors in even the most toxic environments. 

One of the most unique traits of an Ogrym is their toxic breath. They exhale a subtle but potent toxin that is lethal to several types of life forms, particularly fungi, vines, 'chaos growths,' and certain common plants. This trait is not only a biological anomaly but also serves as a deterrent to certain types of enemies and a boon in environments infested with hostile plant life. 

Physically, Ogryms are formidable. Their bodies are muscular and hard-cut, a testament to their immense strength. In battle, their instincts sharpen their reflexes and agility, allowing them to perform surprising feats of dexterity despite their hulking size. Their tusks have evolved to resemble the curved features of Orx rather than the straight, pointed tusks of traditional Ogres, further enhancing their intimidating presence.

Ogryms are an accidental race, and most are sterile. They reproduce asexually, with any two non-sterile Ogryms capable of creating offspring. Despite their lack of biological sex, Ogryms often adopt gender identities, most often male.

# Culture

Ogryms live for hundreds of years and are a slowly dying race, with only a few hundred left among Humanity. Despite their monstrous appearance and behavior, Ogryms are considered part of the umbrella of Humanity. They strive to coexist with their Human counterparts, even as they grapple with their slowly fading existence. As a race born of war, they carry the weight of their history with a sense of honor and duty, often serving as formidable warriors in the fight against the demonic hordes.

# In Society

Their sheer physical presence and the scars of their history often make Ogryms subjects of fear and misunderstanding. However, their inherent strength and resilience make them invaluable assets in battle, and their endurance and resistance to harsh conditions also make them excellent explorers and scouts. Despite the challenges they face, Ogryms strive to find their place in a world that often views them with a mixture of fear and awe.
