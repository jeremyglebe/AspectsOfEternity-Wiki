# Overview

Cyborgs are a synthesis of flesh and steel, characterized by their superior physical strength, durability, and processing capabilities. They were largely born from The Lord of The Forge's attempts to replicate the Astral Vanguard. While they often struggle to maintain their sense of humanity amidst their mechanical nature, Cyborgs possess the unique insight and complexity of human intelligence. 

Their existence is often defined by struggle and resilience, as they strive to find their place in a world that often views them with fear and mistrust. Despite the suspicion and challenges they face, they persist, fueled by a desire to assert their identity and purpose in a world not quite ready to fully accept them.

# Special Abilities

Every Cyborg is entirely unique. Players should work with their GMs to create a custom race for Cyborg characters. Below you will find an example cyborg based on common characteristics of cyborgs in the Aspects of Eternity setting.

| Outsider (Minor)         | Most people distrust cyborgs for some reason. Perhaps itâ€™s their synthetic speech patterns, the chemical-induced emotional numbness, or the hulking metal frame. Cyborgs subtract 2 from Persuasion rolls with all but others of their kind.                                                               |
| Dependency (Electricity) | Cyborgs must find and absorb enough electricity each day to keep their vital functions working. Cyborgs can only safely absorb electricity through their charging cable and are not immune to damage from electricity. Powering a Cyborg takes roughly the same amount of electricity as an average house. |

# History

Cyborgs trace their origins back to The Lord of The Forge's attempts to replicate the Astral Vanguard. This led to the creation of beings that were neither entirely human nor entirely machine, but something in between. This new existence was both a blessing and a curse, as it endowed them with incredible abilities but also alienated them from both their former human companions and their new mechanical kin.

Despite their origin as tools of The Forge, Cyborgs have developed their own sense of identity and purpose, fueled by the unique human intellect that still resides within their mechanical forms. They continue to navigate the challenges of their existence with resilience, striving to assert their identity and find their place in the world.

# Traits

Cyborgs are renowned for their superior physical capabilities and advanced processing powers. Their mechanical nature provides them with a degree of resilience and durability that surpasses that of a regular human, and their advanced processors allow them to analyze and react to situations with incredible speed and precision.

One of the most significant challenges a Cyborg faces is maintaining their sense of humanity amidst their mechanical nature. This struggle often manifests as an identity crisis, a constant tug-of-war between their human past and their mechanical present. Despite this existential struggle, many Cyborgs strive to preserve their sense of self and humanity, refusing to be reduced to mere machines.

# Culture

Despite their rarity and the suspicion they often face, Cyborgs are resilient and persist in their quest for acceptance and understanding. Their culture is one of resilience and adaptability, as they strive to navigate the complexities of their existence and assert their identity in a world often hesitant to accept them.

# In Society

Cyborgs are often seen as tools by Corporations and Banks, a view that is fueled by their origins and their mechanical nature. Despite this, they possess the unique insight and complexity of human intelligence and continue to assert their autonomy and individuality in the face of these challenges.

In many ways, Cyborgs embody the struggle between humanity and technology, serving as a testament to both the incredible potential and the potential pitfalls of such advancements. Their struggle for acceptance and understanding mirrors the broader societal struggle to reconcile the rapid advancement of technology with the timeless values and principles of humanity.
