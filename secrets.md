# Who Is The God-King?

## The God-King's Sacrifice and the Ascension of the White Flame

The cataclysm of Eden was a catastrophe of apocalyptic proportions, brought to bear by the manifestation of the Moon Presence, an ancient and potent outer god. Unleashing its unholy power, it laid waste to the world, transforming a once prosperous civilization into a battlefield of despair and destruction.

It was during this time of chaos and devastation that God-King Aurias made his final stand. With a resolute heart and unwavering determination, he confronted the Moon Presence. In an act of ultimate sacrifice, Aurias used every shred of his divine power to banish the malevolent entity. The cost was his life; his radiant form was extinguished, reduced to a shriveled husk.

At Aurias' side during these cataclysmic events was the White Flame Etehr, a Gnome turned god. Etehr and Aurias shared a bond that transcended their divine status; a friendship that had spanned over a hundred years. Aurias had mentored Etehr since his ascension, guiding him along the divine path.

In his last moments, Aurias spoke to Etehr, his voice echoing with wisdom and resolve.

> To be a god, Etehr, is not to be eternally living. We are but scribes of our own destiny. Our power, it dwelleth in our purpose. My purpose hath been to shield our kinfolk. Now, unto thee, I bestow this duty. In this epoch of shadow, mankind yearns for a beacon; a flame to cleave through the abyss. Thou, the White Flame, shall serve as this beacon. Thou art deserving of the crown.

With Aurias' final words, his light dimmed, leaving a husk. Etehr, mourning his mentor, assumed the mantle of God-King, swearing to safeguard their people.

Etehr's ascension shook the divine and mortal realms alike. The ascent of a demi-human god to the status of God-King was unprecedented. Yet, in the looming darkness, it brought unity to humanity, both man and kin alike. A new, darker era had dawned, yet it was bound together under one unified banner.
