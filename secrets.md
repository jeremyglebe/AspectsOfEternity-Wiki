# The God-King's Sacrifice and the Ascension of the White Flame

The cataclysm of Elysium, the cradle of civilizations, was caused by the manifestation of an ancient and potent outer god, known as the Moon Presence. As the being laid waste to the world, it was God-King Aurias who saved humanity with his last defiance. In a grand act of sacrifice, he used his divine power to banish the Moon Presence. This act, however, cost Aurias his life, and he was reduced to a shriveled husk, his once radiant form extinguished.

His apprentice, the White Flame Etehr, a Gnome ascended to godhood, was at his side during these final moments. Witnessing the sacrifice of Aurias had profound implications, shaking the foundations of their world. A demi-human god, ascending to the mantle of God-King, was an unprecedented event, causing ripples across the divine and mortal realms alike. 

In his final moments, Aurias turned to Etehr, his eyes aflame with wisdom and resolve.

> To be a god is not to be immortal, Etehr,"

he intoned, his voice a mere whisper, yet resonating with the weight of ages.

> In ages past we have lived and died. We are not immortal. We are merely authors of our own fate. Our power is in our purpose and my purpose has been grand. I have protected our people through the ages. I gift this purpose to thee, if thou wilt accept. Humanity, in this era of darkness, needs a light; a flame to cut through the darkness and pave the way. The God-King of the long night shall be the White Flame. Humanity shall come together, man and his brethren, to survive this deathly cold. This I have spoken, this I shall speak: Thou art worthy of a crown.

With these final words, the light in Aurias' eyes dimmed, leaving behind only the shriveled form of what once was a mighty God-King. Mourning the loss of his mentor, Etehr took upon himself the mantle of God-King, vowing to protect their people and lead them to salvation.
