In the world of Eden, there are multiple forms of currency used by different social classes and for various purposes.

# Physical Currency

Physical currency consists of **Gold Crowns**, **Silver Shillings**, and **Brass Pennies**. These coins are used by the working class and some high-end workers.

- 12 Brass Pennies = 1 Silver Shilling
- 20 Silver Shillings = 1 Gold Crown

Physical currency is rarely used by the upper class, as they prefer digital currency.

## Prestige Tokens

Prestige Tokens are an exclusive currency used by the ultra-rich and other important entities, including the Lords Eternal. These tokens represent the exchange of favors and can be seen as a symbol of status and influence among the powerful elite.

# Digital Currency

## Harbor Marks (HM)

Harbor Marks are the primary digital currency used by the upper class and high-end workers. They are associated with the Harbor Bank, and users carry cards linked to the central banking system to manage and use their Harbor Marks.

1 Gold Crown = 100 Harbor Marks
1 Silver Shilling = 5 Harbor Marks
1 Brass Penny = 0.5 Harbor Marks

These conversions can be done through the central banking system or authorized exchange centers, with fees applied.

## Shadow Coin

Shadow Coin is a digital cryptocurrency used for underground business and illegal activities. Banks also use Shadow Coin to perform clandestine operations. The technology required to participate in this currency is out of reach for most people, making it the domain of the underworld and powerful financial institutions.
