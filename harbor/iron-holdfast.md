# Iron Holdfast

![ironholdfast.jpeg](/ironholdfast.jpeg =500x)

Situated on the outskirts of the grand city of Harbor, Iron Holdfast serves as the staging point for expeditions into the enigmatic Overdark Station. Despite its non-incorporated status, this rugged outpost teems with activity, attracting a motley assembly of adventurers, technicians, traders, and scholars. Though it may not officially be under the jurisdiction of Harbor, various forces, including the imperial government, the First Bank of Harbor, and several corporations, subtly exert influence over Iron Holdfast.

## Key Locations

### The Rusty Crowbar
This well-established pub and inn is the heart of Iron Holdfast, offering much-needed food, drink, and rest to explorers returning from the Overdark. Decorated with various relics from the station, its eclectic atmosphere serves as a constant reminder of the potential wealth - or danger - that awaits within the Overdark. 

### Tarn's Launch Site
A heavily fortified launchpad for Overdark expeditions, this is the point of entry for many venturing into the alien structure. It hosts a technomagical portal, colloquially referred to as the "Gate" or "Vortex," and is maintained by a team of skilled technicians and security personnel.

### The Cache
Run by quick-witted trader Maelis "Quickfinger" Vel, The Cache is Iron Holdfast's premier general goods store. Here, explorers can find everything from basic rations to specialized equipment for navigating the hazards of the Overdark.

### Grit & Gear

### The Scroll & Circuit
A research facility cum library, this establishment is run by the eccentric scholar, Doctor Octavius Quill. He offers compensation for any artifacts or data brought back from the Overdark Station, making his facility a hub of information about the station and its countless mysteries.

### Sawbones' Fix-Up Shop
An informal clinic run by Dr. Thaddeus "Sawbones" Crane, this establishment is the primary place in Iron Holdfast for receiving medical aid. Housed in a repurposed cargo container, it's filled with scavenged medical equipment and supplies.
