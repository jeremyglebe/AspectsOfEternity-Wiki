Situated on the outskirts of the grand city of Harbor, Iron Holdfast serves as the staging point for expeditions into the enigmatic Overdark Station. Despite its non-incorporated status, this rugged outpost teems with activity, attracting a motley assembly of adventurers, technicians, traders, and scholars. Though it may not officially be under the jurisdiction of Harbor, various forces, including the imperial government, the First Bank of Harbor, and several corporations, subtly exert influence over Iron Holdfast.
