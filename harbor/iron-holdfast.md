# Iron Holdfast

Iron Holdfast is a small, independent settlement that serves as the central hub for raiders who venture into the Overdark Station. Despite its small size, it is bustling with activity, with a mix of hardened adventurers, technicians, merchants, and scholars who have all come in pursuit of riches, knowledge, or the thrill of exploration.

## Key Locations

**The Rusty Crowbar**: This is the central pub/inn of Iron Holdfast, serving as a meeting place, tavern, and lodging for raiders. It is run by the retired warrior Garrick "Old Iron" Tarn, a grizzled veteran who has seen his fair share of battles and expeditions into the Overdark. The Rusty Crowbar is decorated with relics from the station, creating an eclectic and unique atmosphere.

**Tarn's Launch Site**: This is the launching point for expeditions into the Overdark Station. The site includes a technomagical portal, often referred to as the "Gate" or "Vortex", that facilitates the transportation to and from the station. The site is heavily fortified and is overseen by a team of technicians and security personnel.

**The Cache**: A general goods store run by a shrewd trader, Maelis "Quickfinger" Vel, who prides herself on having everything a raider might need. From rations and basic supplies to specialized equipment for navigating the Overdark, if you can't find it in The Cache, you probably don't need it.

**Grit & Gear**: A blacksmith and repair shop run by a pair of sibling artificers, Rollo and Rina Forgeheart. Their skills in crafting, repairing, and modifying equipment are second to none in Iron Holdfast.

**The Scroll & Circuit**: This is a small research facility cum library run by an eccentric scholar, Doctor Octavius Quill. He is always eager to purchase any artifacts or data from the Overdark Station, and his place is a wealth of information about the station and its mysteries.

## Notable NPCs

**Garrick "Old Iron" Tarn**: The proprietor of The Rusty Crowbar and the de facto leader of Iron Holdfast, Garrick is a towering figure with a scarred face and a booming laugh. His long white hair is typically tied in a rough knot, and his piercing blue eyes seem to miss nothing. Garrick is always ready to offer advice to new raiders, share tales of his past exploits, or break up fights with his trusty iron crowbar.

**Maelis "Quickfinger" Vel**: The quick-witted and nimble-fingered proprietor of The Cache, Maelis is an elf with an eye for valuable goods. Her auburn hair is streaked with gray, and her green eyes sparkle with a cunning intelligence. Despite her somewhat shifty appearance, Maelis is a fair trader and an essential part of the Iron Holdfast community.

**Rollo and Rina Frogheart**: The sibling duo behind Grit & Gear, Rollo and Rina are hardworking and passionate about their craft. Rollo, the elder of the two, is a burly man with a thick beard and a jovial demeanor. Rina, on the other hand, is slender and quick, with a sharp tongue and an even sharper mind. Together, they make a formidable team.

**Doctor Octavius Quill**: The eccentric scholar who runs The Scroll & Circuit, Dr. Quill is a man of unbridled curiosity and vast knowledge. His wild, unkempt hair and the ink stains on his hands are testament to his relentless pursuit of knowledge. Despite his slightly mad appearance, he is well-respected and is a valuable source of information.

Dr. Thaddeus "Sawbones" Crane.

Dr. Thaddeus Crane, known colloquially as "Sawbones," is the resident physician of Iron Holdfast. He doesn't hold an official license - his medical training is a mix of experience, intuition, and a personal collection of medical books and data slates. Nonetheless, he is the go-to figure for medical aid in the camp.

Sawbones is a man of indeterminable age, with crow's feet and laugh lines that suggest both a life lived long and hard, yet full of humor. He sports a bushy white beard that obscures much of his face, but his eyes - sharp and blue - betray a keen mind and a steady hand.

Dr. Crane runs a small clinic, aptly named "Sawbones' Fix-Up Shop," out of a repurposed cargo container. The clinic is filled with an assortment of scavenged medical equipment, supplies, and curious items he's collected over the years. It's not as sterile as a hospital, but Sawbones prides himself on his ability to patch up anything from gunshot wounds to alien spore infections.

Despite his unconventional methods and sometimes gruff demeanor, Sawbones is a kind-hearted individual with a genuine care for the community. He has a particular soft spot for novice adventurers, always ready to impart some grizzled advice along with his treatments. Though he would never admit it, he sees himself as a sort of paternal figure in the camp - always there with a bandage and a bit of tough love when needed.
