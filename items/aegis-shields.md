# AEGIS Shields for Savage Worlds Adventure Edition

## Overview

AEGIS (Advanced Energy Guarding & Interception System) Shields remain a revolutionary defensive technology within the realm of Harbor. Developed by the ingenious engineers of the Lords Eternal, these energy-based shields provide a level of protection unparalleled by traditional armor or defenses. They are especially coveted for their capacity to absorb damage and self-regenerate, rendering them valuable for soldiers, mercenaries, and adventurers.

## History

The genesis of the AEGIS Shields lies within the ascension period of the Lords Eternal. With a drive to technologically safeguard their forces in combat and to secure their supremacy, the Lords Eternal initiated the AEGIS project. This technology was a game-changer, instilling confidence and offering an unprecedented level of protection for the troops in battle.

In its initial phase, the AEGIS shields were exclusive to the Lords Eternal's elite units. However, as time progressed, the technology began seeping into the hands of the general populace. Even though these publicly available versions may lack the advanced capabilities of the original, they still offer a significant edge in combat scenarios.

## Mechanics

The AEGIS shields in SWADE function as an extra pool of hit points that can absorb damage before it impacts the user. The number of Shield Points (SP) and the rate at which they regenerate depends on the specific model and quality of the AEGIS shield. Each shield possesses the following characteristics:

- Shield Points (SP): The number of hit points the shield can absorb before it is depleted and attacks start to damage the user.
- Regeneration Die: The die rolled to determine the number of Shield Points regenerated after a set number of rounds.
- Regeneration Rate: The number of rounds that must pass before the shield regenerates.
- Traits: Special abilities or enhancements such as Overcharge, Harmonize, and Siphon, which may vary between different models of shields.
- Special Cases: Certain damage types or environmental factors that affect the shield's performance, either positively or negatively.

## AEGIS Shield Traits

- Overcharge: Allows the user to spend a Benny to temporarily increase the maximum SP of the AEGIS shield by an amount equal to their Spirit die type for a number of rounds equal to their Spirit die type.
- Harmonize: Enables the user to link their shield with an ally's AEGIS shield. While linked, the characters add together their SP and divide them evenly. The shield with the lower regen die is used.
- Siphon: Provides the user the ability to regain SP equal to half the damage (rounded down) from an energy-based attack they are hit with, up to the original SP of the shield.
- Counterpulse: Costs a Benny to activate as a reaction to an attack. Creates an explosive counterforce (25% Cone Template facing the attacker) dealing damage equal to the Retaliation Value (RV) percentage of the incoming attack. Knocks the shield user back 1 inch for every 25 RV (rounded down) and makes them prone. Each use depletes one charge; shield ceases to function when all charges are expended until specific recharging requirements are met.

## Conclusion

With their remarkable defensive capabilities, AEGIS shields have become an integral component of warfare and personal security in the world of Harbor. The promise of enhanced survival that these advanced energy shields provide makes them an invaluable tool in any combat situation. As this technology continues to develop and become more accessible, AEGIS shields are set to remain a dominating presence in the battlefield.

## Sample Shield: AEGIS Mark IV Personal Shield

| A.E.G.I.S. Mark IV Personal Shield |                                                               |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SP                                 | 12                                                            |
| Regen Die                          | d6                                                            |
| Regen Rate                         | Every 3 rounds                                                |
| Traits                             | Overcharge, Harmonize, Energy Siphon                 |
| Special Cases                      | Vulnerability 4 (EMP, Ion), Environmental Resistance 2 (Cold) |

### Explanations

- **Overcharge**: As a once per encounter ability, when the shield is depleted and the wearer would take damage, they can activate this ability to instantly recharge the shield to full, providing all SP again. After using this ability, the shield's regen rate is doubled for the remainder of the encounter.
- **Harmonize**: If the character has not taken damage for 3 rounds, they may roll their regen die to regain SP.
- **Energy Siphon**: Absorb 50% of incoming energy damage to recharge the shield more quickly. Gain additional SP up to the original maximum of the shield.
- **Vulnerability**: The shield's SP is reduced by 4 against EMP and ion damage, making it more susceptible to these types of attacks.
Environmental Resistance: In low-temperature environments, the shield gains +2 SP, making it more effective in these conditions.
