# **Elysys: A Primer for New Players**

Welcome to Elysys! An exciting world where advanced technology meets arcane arts, where humans and human-adjacent races coexist, where corporations strive for dominance, and where ancient ruins wait to be explored.

## **The Local Area: Iron Holdfast and Harbor**

Your adventures will mainly take place in the local area: **Iron Holdfast** and **Harbor**.

**Iron Holdfast** is the bustling, gritty heart of Harbor. It's the central hub for scavengers and workers living amidst towering scrap yards, mechanic shops, seedy taverns, and more. 

**Harbor** is the larger entity, a city-state inside a hollowed-out asteroid. It's a melting pot of diverse cultures and races, with sections controlled by various corporations, guilds, and powerful figures.

## **The Overdark Station**

Overdark Station, an ancient ruin filled with artifacts and mystery, lies on the edge of Harbor. With its unique environments and alien lifeforms, it attracts corporations and adventurers eager for wealth and knowledge.

## **Races: Ancestries and Origins**

In Elysys, Humanity with a capital 'H' unites diverse races. 

- **Humans**: The most numerous and adaptable of races.
- **Hobmen (Hobs)**: Agile descendants of halflings, resistant to exhaustion, hunger, and sleep deprivation.
- **Feymen (Fyms)**: Descendants of elves, known for their beauty, longevity, and affinity for magic.
- **Gnismen (Meks)**: Descendants of gnomes, possessing a knack for invention and mechanics.
- **Ogmen (Oggs)**: Descendants of ogres, large, strong, and nature-loving.
- **Dwarves**: Short, sturdy beings with impressive hardiness and craftmanship.
- **Ogryms**: Monstrous offshoots of ogres, slow yet agile and formidable in combat.

Origins offer another layer to your character's identity:

- **Mutants**: Individuals with chaotic, mutant DNA, possessing diverse appearances and abilities.
- **Cyborgs**: A synthesis of flesh and steel, with enhanced physical strength, durability, and processing capabilities.

## **Currency in Harbor**

Harbor has a diverse monetary system.

- **Physical Currency**: Gold Crowns, Silver Shillings, and Brass Pennies for day-to-day transactions.
- **Prestige Tokens**: An exclusive currency symbolizing status and influence among the elite.
- **Harbor Marks**: Digital currency, used by the upper class, as well as corporate or educated workers.
- **Shadow Coin**: A digital cryptocurrency for underground business and clandestine operations.

The cost to convert physical to digital currency and obtain a bank card may differ, leading to potential disparities and tensions among social classes.

## **Corporations and Guilds**

Many corporations are active in Harbor, each with its unique goals and interests. Nova-X Industries, Stellar Horizons Corporation, Genesis Biotech, Aegis Dynamics, Mystech Consortium, Oracle Information Systems, First Bank of Harbor, and the notorious Scratch 'n' Scrounge Universal Salvage, all shape the power dynamics of the city-state.

Guilds and organizations offer opportunities for adventurers. The Astral Vanguard, for instance, are heroes of old with members drawn from all ancestries.

## **Your Adventure Begins**

Now, prepare yourself for a thrilling journey through Elysys. It's a world filled with opportunities and challenges, waiting for you to leave your mark. Will you seek fortune in the depths of Overdark Station, navigate the intricate politics of Harbor, or perhaps shape the future of your chosen guild? The choice is yours.
