**Iron Holdfast** is a bustling, gritty settlement on the outskirts of Harbor. It's the central hub for scavengers and raiders living amidst towering scrap yards, gear shops, seedy pubs, and more. 

**Harbor** is the larger entity, a city-state and the last bastion of Humanity and the Empire. It is hardened, yet hopeful, place with various corporations, guilds, and powerful figures always vying for control.

# **The Overdark Station**

The Overdark Station, an ancient moon-sized space station of alien origin looms in the sky above Harbor. It is filled with artifacts and mystery. With its unique environments and alien lifeforms, it attracts corporations and adventurers eager for wealth and knowledge.
