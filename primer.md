Welcome to Eden! An exciting world where advanced technology meets arcane arts, where humans and human-adjacent races coexist, where corporations strive for dominance, and where ancient ruins wait to be explored.

# **A Place to Call Home**

Your adventures will mainly take place in the local settlements of humanity: **Iron Holdfast** and **Harbor**.

**Iron Holdfast** is a bustling, gritty settlement on the outskirts of Harbor. It's the central hub for scavengers and raiders living amidst towering scrap yards, gear shops, seedy pubs, and more. 

**Harbor** is the larger entity, a city-state and the last bastion of Humanity and the Empire. It is hardened, yet hopeful, place with various corporations, guilds, and powerful figures always vying for control.

# **The Shadow Upon The City**

No calming, luminescent moon circles Eden. Wise men say that in ancient times such a rock did orbit the planet. Now, however, there is only The Overdark Station. An ancient moon-sized space station of alien origin looms in the sky above Harbor. It is filled with artifacts and mystery. With its unique environments and alien lifeforms, it attracts corporations and adventurers eager for wealth and knowledge. Scavenging the Overdark is Humanity's only method of obtaining advanced technology since their devastating loss in the Exodus War resulted in their libaries and data being mostly destroyed.

# **Our Origins**

In Eden, Humanity with a capital 'H' unites diverse races. 

- **Humans**: The most numerous and adaptable of races.
- **Hobmen (Hobs)**: Agile descendants of halflings, resistant to exhaustion, hunger, and sleep deprivation.
- **Feymen (Fyms)**: Descendants of elves, known for their beauty, longevity, and affinity for magic.
- **Gnismen (Meks)**: Descendants of gnomes, possessing a knack for invention and mechanics.
- **Ogmen (Oggs)**: Descendants of ogres, large, strong, and nature-loving.
- **Dwarves**: Short, sturdy beings with impressive hardiness and craftmanship.
- **Ogryms**: Monstrous offshoots of ogres, slow yet agile and formidable in combat.

Origins offer another layer to your character's identity:

- **Mutants**: Individuals with chaotic, mutant DNA, possessing diverse appearances and abilities.
- **Cyborgs**: A synthesis of flesh and steel, with enhanced physical strength, durability, and processing capabilities.

# **Whats in It For Me?**

Harbor has a diverse monetary system.

- **Physical Currency**: Gold Crowns, Silver Shillings, and Brass Pennies for day-to-day transactions.
- **Harbor Marks**: Digital currency, used by the upper class, as well as corporate or educated workers.
- **Shadow Coin**: A digital cryptocurrency for underground business and clandestine operations.

The cost to convert physical to digital currency and obtain a bank card may differ, leading to potential disparities and tensions among social classes.

# **Follow The Money...**

Many corporations are active in Harbor, each with its unique goals and interests. Nova-X Industries, Stellar Horizons Corporation, Genesis Biotech, Aegis Dynamics, Mystech Consortium, Oracle Information Systems, First Bank of Harbor, and the notorious Scratch 'n' Scrounge Universal Salvage, all shape the power dynamics of the city-state.

# **Your Adventure Begins**

Now, prepare yourself for a thrilling journey through Eden. It's a world filled with opportunities and challenges, waiting for you to leave your mark. Will you seek fortune in the depths of Overdark Station, navigate the intricate politics of Harbor, or perhaps shape the future of your chosen guild? The choice is yours. Welcome to Eden, adventurer. We wish you luck!
