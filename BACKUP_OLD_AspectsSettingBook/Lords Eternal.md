# Lords Eternal

The Lords Eternal are a group of powerful demi-god mutants selected from birth to serve as elite warriors in the God-Emperor's army. Blessed by the God-Emperor himself, these individuals possess extraordinary abilities and were instrumental in leading Humanity during its time in the stars. As of the return to Eden, only six Lords Eternal remain, each struggling to uphold their duty and restore the Aspects of Eternity.

## History

In the early days of the God-Emperor's rule, he foresaw the need for an elite force to defend Humanity against the numerous threats in the cosmos. Thus, he established the Lords Eternal, an order of demi-god mutants gifted with immense strength, speed, intelligence, and the ability to wield powerful divine magick. Trained from a young age, subjected to powerful mutagens, and imbued with the God-Emperor's blessings, the Lords Eternal quickly became a formidable force in the God-Emperor's army.

Throughout the interstellar wars with the alien "Other," the Lords Eternal were at the forefront of every battle, using their might and divine power to protect the remnants of Humanity. As the wars raged on, the Lords Eternal were further augmented with advanced power suits, enhancing their capabilities and turning them into near-unstoppable warriors.

## Mutation Process

The Lords Eternal, in addition to their divine blessings, undergo a dangerous and transformative mutation process. This process involves a series of painful and risky procedures that alter their bodies on a cellular level, granting them the ability to imbibe and draw strength from decoctions that would be lethal to ordinary mortals.

These mutations also serve to enhance their reflexes, making them formidable combatants, and enable their bodies to act as more effective conduits for magick. The mutation process, while granting the Lords Eternal incredible abilities, is not without its risks and side effects, which can include a vulnerability to certain addictive substances like [Starfire Elixir](Starfire%20Elixir.md).

## The Remaining Six

After the God-Emperor's death and the decision to return to Eden, the Lords Eternal found their numbers dwindling, with many lost in the chaos of the journey or during the ongoing battles. At present, only six Lords Eternal remain, each commanding their own factions within the city of Harbor. These six are:

1. [**Lord of Harbor**](Eldric%20Stargazer.md) - As the de facto leader of the remaining Lords Eternal, the Lord of Harbor oversees the city's defenses and manages its resources. He is known for his tactical prowess and unwavering dedication to the God-Emperor's vision.

2. **Lady of Shadows** - An enigmatic figure, the Lady of Shadows is a master of espionage and intelligence gathering. She operates covertly, using her extensive network of spies and informants to root out threats from within and outside Harbor.

3. **Lord of the Forge** - Tasked with maintaining and advancing Harbor's technology, the Lord of the Forge works tirelessly to uncover the secrets of the Overdark Station and recover lost human knowledge. He is a skilled inventor and engineer, responsible for many of the city's technological advancements.

4. **Lady of the Wilds** - Adept at harnessing the untamed power of Eden's wilderness, the Lady of the Wilds is responsible for training and leading scouts, hunters, and survivalists. She possesses an unparalleled affinity for the natural world and is skilled in both tracking and combat.

5. **Lord of the Arcane** - As the foremost authority on divine magick, the Lord of the Arcane is dedicated to researching and harnessing the magical energies that permeate the world. He is instrumental in uncovering the secrets of the Aspects of Eternity and is a formidable spellcaster in his own right.

6. **Lady of Healing** - A compassionate and wise figure, the Lady of Healing oversees the well-being of Harbor's citizens. She is a skilled healer and practitioner of restorative magick, and her knowledge of medicine has saved countless lives.

## Current Challenges

The remaining Lords Eternal face numerous challenges as they strive to rebuild Harbor and fulfill the God-Emperor's final command. With their power suits slowly losing energy, they must use their abilities sparingly and rely on their resourcefulness and leadership skills. Furthermore, they must navigate the complex political landscape of Harbor, manage their factions, and protect the city from the relentless onslaught of demonic forces and the hostile environment of Eden. Ultimately, their most significant task is to locate and reclaim the lost Aspects of Eternity, as instructed by the God-Emperor, in order to restore his immortality and resurrect him to lead Humanity once more.

As the Lords Eternal continue their struggle against the demons, hostile flora and fauna, and the ever-looming threat of the "Other," they also face internal divisions and the challenges of leadership. Each Lord Eternal has their own priorities and methods, occasionally leading to conflicts and tension between them. In these trying times, they must find a way to work together and overcome their differences for the greater good of Humanity and the fulfillment of the God-Emperor's command. Only by uniting their strengths can the Lords Eternal hope to achieve their goals and secure a future for the last of Humanity.
