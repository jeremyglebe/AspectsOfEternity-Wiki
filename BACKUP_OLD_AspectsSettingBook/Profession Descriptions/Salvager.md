## Archetypes

### Scrounger

The Scrounger is a Salvager who specializes in finding and recovering valuable trinkets and baubles of unknown value. They have a keen eye for identifying items that may be valuable to collectors, researchers, or those seeking to uncover the past. Scroungers may sometimes even be employed by those looking to find items of value in the estate of a deceased individual.

#### Keen Appraisal

As a Scrounger, you have developed a keen eye for determining the value of items.

Effect: Gain a +20 bonus when appraising the value of an item to Scrutinize, Tradecraft, Counterfeit, or other relevant skill tests.

#### Treasure Hunter

As a seasoned Scrounger, you have developed a knack for finding valuable items hidden within ruins, scrapyards, and other locations. Your keen senses and intuition allow you to uncover valuable resources and artifacts that others might overlook.

Effect: When attempting to locate valuable items or resources, you gain a +10 Base Chance to relevant skill tests (such as Skulduggery or Awareness). Additionally, you may spend a fortune point to automatically scavenge an item of value or significance in your immediate vicinity. (The exact area is up to the GM's discretion) If no such item is present, the GM may choose to instead provide a clue to the location of such an item.

### Scrapper

The Scrapper is a Salvager who specializes in digging through junkyards and finding valuable parts of machinery. They are skilled in identifying valuable components, either in material or function, and know how to extract them efficiently. Scrappers play an essential role in keeping Harbor running by recovering and repurposing functional parts from discarded machines.

#### Component Expert

As a Scrapper, you have extensive experience working with machinery and its components. Your expertise allows you to quickly identify and extract valuable parts from discarded machines, as well as repair and repurpose them for use in functioning devices.

Effect: When attempting to salvage, extract, or repurpose machinery components, you gain a +10 Base Chance to relevant Tradecraft, Skulduggery, or other relevant skill tests. (This does not circumvent requirements for tools or knowledge of the item's function.)

#### Reverse Engineering

Your expertise in handling machinery and understanding their inner workings allows you to reverse engineer items to learn how they function or how to recreate them. 

When handling an engineered item of some complexity, make a Tradecraft or Xenoscience test. On a successful test, you gain insight into the item's function and any test to recreate or repair it is treated as one difficulty step easier. On a critical success, you are able to create a blueprint of the item (or some of its components) and creatures who read the blueprint gain the same benefit.
