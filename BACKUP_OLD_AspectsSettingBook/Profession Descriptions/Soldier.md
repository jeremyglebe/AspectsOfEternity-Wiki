# Soldier

Soldiers are the backbone of any military force. They are the ones who do the fighting, and they are the ones who are expected to do the fighting. There are three main archetypes for Soldiers: Infantry, Heavy Weapons, and Sniper.

## Requirements

Military training or equivalent experience.

### Equipment Requirements

Melee Weapon, Ranged Weapon, Armor, Ammunition

## Starting Equipment (if Basic Tier)

Knife, Rifle, Ammunition (x10), Light Armor, Grenade (x2), Rations (x10), First Aid Kit, Binoculars, Nav System

## Archetypes

### Infantry

Infantry are the standard foot soldiers, the ones who are expected to be everywhere and do everything. They are often the first line of defense and are skilled in various forms of combat.

#### Adaptable Warrior

As an Infantry soldier, you have been trained to adapt to various combat situations and effectively utilize different weapons and tactics.

Effect: When using any melee or ranged weapon, you gain a +10 Base Chance to Melee Combat or Ranged Combat checks. Additionally, once per session, you can reroll a failed Melee Combat or Ranged Combat check.

### Heavy Weapons

Heavy Weapons soldiers are the ones who are expected to be in the thick of the fight, but who are also expected to be able to take a lot of punishment. They specialize in handling heavy weaponry and providing cover fire for their allies.

#### Brute Force

As a Heavy Weapons soldier, you have learned to use your strength and resilience to your advantage, both when wielding heavy weaponry and when taking a hit.

Effect: When using heavy weaponry or attempting to withstand an attack, you gain a +10 Base Chance to Ranged Combat or Toughness checks. Additionally, once per session, you can negate one instance of damage.

### Sniper

Snipers are the ones who are expected to take out the enemy from a distance and do so with a high degree of accuracy. They are masters of stealth and precision, able to eliminate targets without being detected.

#### Marked Precision

As a Sniper, you have honed your skills in long-range combat and have an uncanny ability to hit your target regardless of the distance.

Effect: When considering penalties for firing ranged weapons, you may choose to treat the distance as one step closer. For example, you may treat Long Distance as Medium Distance, and Medium Distance as Short Distance. If combined with the Eagle Eyes talent (which has a similar effect), you may treat Long Distance as Short Distance.

#### Phantom Presence

As a Sniper, you have learned to disguise your presence by keeping low and staying still, allowing you to remain undetected by your enemies.

Effect: You may use the Take Cover action to become prone. When you become prone this way, you are always considered to be behind, at minimum, low cover thereby gaining a +3 Damage Threshold against ranged weapons. (You may be behind greater cover circumstantially) When prone and not moving, you gain a +20 Base Chance to Stealth checks and you are considered out of line of sight of all creatures for the purposes of making a stealth check.
