# Starfire Elixir

The Starfire Elixir is a rare and potent substance known for its powerful pain-relieving and enhancing properties. Primarily used to ease the pain of death for the terminally ill and bring about a swifter end, the elixir is considered a luxury on Eden, where death often comes at the hands of the hostile environment or demonic forces.

For the [Lords Eternal](Lords%20Eternal.md) and other similarly mutated individuals, the Starfire Elixir provides a temporary boost in strength, heightened senses, and increased mental clarity. However, these benefits come at a high cost, as the elixir is highly addictive and can lead to long-term health issues.

Due to its specialized use and the limited supplies available, the Starfire Elixir is not commonly found in apothecaries, and those who do possess it hold significant leverage over those with an addiction to the substance.
