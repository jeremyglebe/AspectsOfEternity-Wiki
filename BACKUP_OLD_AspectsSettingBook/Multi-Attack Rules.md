# Multi-Attack Rules

Generally speaking, a character may only perform one attack action per turn. Dual wielding weapons and certain traits or talents may allow for multiple attacks under certain circumstances. In the event that a player makes additional attack actions, a difficulty penalty is applied against the player. The difficulty penalty increases by one step for each additional attack and applies both to the attacking character and inversely to the defending character. (For example, the third attack roll would be made at -20% and a defender parrying it would be at +20%) Difficulty maximums (+/-30% for Trivial/Arduous) are still applicable if other difficulty effects are active.

## Dual Wielding

When you are holding a weapon in each hand, you may make an attack with both weapons. The attack made with the weapon in your off-hand is increased in difficulty by one step in addition to any multi-attack penalties. However, you may attack with your off-hand first. (Meaning that your first attack would be at -10% from off-hand, and your second would also be at -10% for multi-attack, instead of -0% and -20%)

## Notable Multi-Attack Talents

### Arc Lightning

When casting a spell which inflicts lightning damage, you may spend an additional AP to arc your lightning to all characters adjacent to the target. This counts as a single attack. Roll damage in an identical manner to the original spell. Each defender resists with a Coordination or Toughness test. On failure, they take the full damage while ignoring 1 point of their armor value. On critical failure, they take double damage while ignoring 2 points of their armor value. On success, the defender does not take damage. On critical success, each character adjacent to the defender automatically succeeds their test as well. When arc lightning is used repeatedly, targets cannot be struck by the arc lightning multiple times, and remember that you can only spread lightning from one additional target for each AP spent. This attack is subject  to the multi-attack rules.

### Death Blow

When you successfully slay an enemy in combat, you may immediately spend an AP to perform another attack on an enemy within range. These attacks are subject to multi-attack rules.

### Golden Opportunity

When a character within your reach provokes an attack of opportunity, they cause surrounding characters to falter, misstep, or reveal a weakness. For 1AP you may make an additional opportunity attack against any character adjacent to the original target and within your range. This attack is subject to the multi-attack rules.

### Whirlwind Strike

When there are 2 or more characters in your melee range and you successfully make an attack against one of them, you may spend an additional AP to perform a Whirlwind Strike. This attack targets all of the remaining characters in your melee range using a single Melee Combat skill test. (This counts as one attack and you roll damage once, but each defender parries/dodges and resists damage separately) This attack is subject to multi-attack rules.

## Action Economy Solutions for Boss-Type Enemies

It is typical for Boss enemies to be given reaction-only bonus AP to help balance them against multi-attacks and large-party action economy advantages. This additional AP can only be used for reactions, making the boss enemies more challenging and encouraging players to strategize and consider their actions more carefully when facing powerful foes.
