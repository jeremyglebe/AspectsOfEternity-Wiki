# Cyborgs

## Overview

Cyborgs represent a unique group within the umbrella of Humanity, individuals whose biological bodies have been heavily augmented or even completely replaced with cybernetic enhancements. Once an early experiment of The Lord of The Forge in an attempt to create a substitute for the Astral Vanguard, Cyborgs have since become a rare sight within Humanity.

## History

The inception of Cyborgs traces back to the Lord of The Forge's early attempts to replicate the Astral Vanguard's might through technology. Despite the initial promise, he ultimately abandoned the project in favor of the mutative Proto-Vanguards, which were closer to the original Vanguard in nature. 

However, the technology involved in the creation of Cyborgs leaked, finding its way into the hands of various corporations and banks. These entities continued the production of Cyborgs, replacing androids with these mechanically-enhanced humans due to the preference for "genuine" human intelligence. 

## Traits

The primary life functions and mechanisms of interaction for Cyborgs are mostly, if not entirely, mechanical in nature. Some Cyborgs may possess little to no organic tissue, retaining only a human brain encased within a fully mechanized body. Their mechanical augmentations can provide an array of enhanced physical capabilities, such as superior strength, speed, and durability, as well as various built-in tools and systems. 

On the flip side, these augmentations can make Cyborgs susceptible to issues that typically affect machines, such as malfunction, hacking, or need for maintenance and power.

## Society and Culture

Cyborgs are a rarity within Humanity, and their mechanical nature often sets them apart from the rest. They are typically viewed with a mix of awe, fear, and suspicion due to their heavily mechanized bodies and the potential capabilities that they possess.

Within the workforce, particularly in corporations and banks, Cyborgs are highly valued for their human intelligence coupled with their enhanced abilities. However, they may also face discrimination and prejudice due to their stark difference from typical Humans and the misconceptions about their nature.

In battle, the enhanced physical capabilities of Cyborgs can make them formidable opponents or invaluable allies. Their mechanical nature can also provide unique advantages, such as resistance to certain forms of attack or the ability to interface with and control other machines.
