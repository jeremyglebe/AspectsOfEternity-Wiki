# Mutants

## Overview

Mutants represent a unique facet of Humanity, a group of individuals who possess traits and abilities borne from the chaotic influences of Eden's environment or the deliberate application of mutagenic processes. These traits often align with the characteristics of chaos beings such as Orx (Orcs), Skavs (rat men), and Aztlan (lizard folk), leading to a diverse array of physical appearances and abilities among mutants.

## History

Mutants have existed ever since Humanity's return to Eden, a direct result of the planet's chaotic energies and the experimental efforts of The Lord of The Forge. Some mutants have their origins in the Proto-Vanguard, warriors subjected to mutagenic processes in an attempt to recreate the Astral Vanguard's power. Others may be ordinary people who have been affected by Eden's corruptive energies or who have been deliberately mutated by illicit substances.

## Traits

Mutant traits vary widely based on the nature of their mutation. Some may possess the brutish strength and hardened skin of the Orx, the agility and heightened senses of the Skavs, or the regenerative abilities and cold-blooded nature of the Aztlan. Mutants born from the Proto-Vanguard often exhibit enhanced physical abilities, but suffer from volatile mutations and dependency on mutagenic elixirs.

However, these enhancements often come with significant drawbacks. The same mutations that grant them their unique abilities can also cause physical and mental instability, a susceptibility to chaos corruption, and a range of other unpredictable side effects.

## Society and Culture

Despite their unique abilities, mutants often face stigma and prejudice within Humanity due to their unnatural origins and volatile nature. They are often seen as outcasts and may be feared or shunned by those who do not understand their unique condition.

However, some mutants have formed their own communities and cultures, building societies that accept and celebrate their unique abilities. These societies often exist on the fringes of the more established Human settlements, providing a haven for mutants and others who are shunned by mainstream Humanity.

In the fight against the demonic forces on Eden, mutants play a crucial role. Their unique abilities often make them invaluable assets on the battlefield, and their willingness to fight in the face of societal prejudice is a testament to their resilience and determination.
