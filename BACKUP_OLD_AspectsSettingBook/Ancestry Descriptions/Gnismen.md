# Gnismen

## Overview

Gnismen, often referred to as "Meks" in common parlance, are an ancestry of Humanity that can trace their lineage back to the gnomes of old. They are uniquely defined by their lean stature, rounded noses, and ears that curl to a point. Gnismen are known for their intellectual prowess, logical thinking, and a particular knack for mechanical engineering and invention. They possess a natural affinity for technology and can often be found working on intricate devices or complex machinery.

## History

The Gnismen are descendants of gnomes, an ancient race known for their ingenuity and mechanical expertise. This ancestral heritage has imbued the Gnismen with a deep-rooted fascination for machines and technology. Over the millennia, their ancestral affinity for engineering has evolved into an integral part of their identity, shaping their culture, lifestyle, and societal role within Humanity.

## Traits

Gnismen are not as physically imposing as some other members of Humanity, but they compensate for this with their intellectual capabilities. They possess an almost intuitive understanding of mechanical devices, enabling them to easily build, modify, and repair intricate machinery. Additionally, Gnismen are known for their sharp memory and keen analytical skills, which further augment their natural aptitude for technology and invention.

Gnismen also possess a unique physical trait - their bodies are naturally resistant to electrical shocks, a likely evolutionary response to their close interaction with machinery and technology. However, their bodies are lean and not well-suited for physical labor or combat, making them more reliant on their technological inventions for protection and defense.

## Society and Culture

Gnismen society is largely organized around their technological prowess. They are frequently employed in roles that require a deep understanding of machines, such as engineers, inventors, and technicians. Their contributions to Humanity's technological advancement are widely recognized and valued, despite occasional societal prejudices against them.

However, Gnismen also face significant societal biases. A common stereotype paints them as cold, emotionless, and overly logical, often leading to their exclusion from social gatherings and communal activities. A derogatory term, "Gnob", has even emerged. This term not only belittles the Gnismen by equating them with the Hobmen, implying they are indistinguishable and lack unique value, but also carries a crude connotation, likening them to genitalia in a crude and disrespectful manner.

Despite these challenges, Gnismen continue to play a crucial role in Humanity's struggle for survival on Eden, contributing their technological expertise and inventive genius to the fight against the demonic forces.
