# Humans

## Overview

Humans are the most common and diverse race within the spectrum of Humanity, acting as the base from which all other demi-human races have branched. They are a resilient and adaptable species, capable of thriving in a variety of environments and circumstances.

## History

Humans originate from a time long before the war of the stars, a time when their ancestors were confined to a single planet. When the God-Emperor revealed the existence of the wider cosmos and its plethora of threats, humans were the first to be chosen to stand as defenders. Their tenacity and adaptability made them suitable candidates for the transformation into the Astral Vanguard.

As time went by, humans mixed with the demi-human races, giving rise to the variety of hybrid species seen today. Despite this, pure humans remain in significant numbers, continuing to play crucial roles in the survival and advancement of Humanity.

## Traits

Humans are known for their adaptability and versatility. They possess no specific extraordinary physical traits when compared to other races within Humanity, but their capacity to learn, adapt, and specialize allows them to excel in virtually any field.

This adaptability extends to their psychological resilience. Humans are known to endure hardships and bounce back from adversities, a trait that has enabled their survival in the chaotic environment of Eden.

## Society and Culture

Human society is as diverse as its members. Cultural practices, societal norms, and traditions vary widely across different human communities. This diversity is a testament to the human capacity for creativity and adaptation.

Humans occupy every stratum of society, from the humblest laborer to the highest-ranking official. They can be found in all walks of life, working as scholars, soldiers, artisans, leaders, and more.

Despite their adaptability and resilience, humans are not free from prejudice and bias. As the base race, they are sometimes viewed as 'plain' or 'ordinary' by other races within Humanity. However, their indispensable role in the formation and sustenance of Humanity is universally recognized.
