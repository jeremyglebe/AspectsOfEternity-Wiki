## Profession Descriptions

Every profession will contain the following information/options:
1. **Profession Name** - The name of the profession.
2. **Archetype Traits** - Each time the profession is taken, the character will gain one of the archetypal traits representing what sub-specialization they have pursued. These traits are listed in the table below. All professions will have at least two, some will have more.
3. **Requirements** - The requirements for taking the profession. These are listed in the table below. Some professions will have no requirements, some will have a few, and some will have a lot. Requirements may include existing skill ranks (classes which have these requirements are called "Expert" professions), signature items (which will be *given* to the player if this is their first profession), or even more abstract things like social status, languages, or education levels.
4. **Drawbacks** - Some professions will have drawbacks, which are listed in the table below. These are things that the character has to deal with in order to pursue their profession. (These are more common in combat-heavy or magick-heavy professions.)
5. **Skills** - There will be 10 skills in each profession that the character must gain a skill rank in to complete the profession. Some professions may list "Open" as one or more of the skill advancements. "Open" represents characters who have a lot of freedom in how they pursue their profession. To that end, an "Open" skill advancement allows a character to gain a rank in *any* skill they choose, so long as it is not already explicitly listed in the profession's skills. (Professions should not contain repeat skills) Scouts, Pilots, and Scavengers are all examples of professions where someone might learn a variety of skills.
6. **Bonus Advances** - Each profession will be able to advance their attribute bonuses a total of 7 times each tier. There are 9 bonus advances listed, but the character will only be able to gain 7. There are 7 total attributes and each attribute may be listed twice at the most. (Combat, Brawn, Agility, Perception, Intelligence, Willpower, and Fellowship) Example: The Proto-Vanguard has the following bonus advance options: Combat, Combat, Brawn, Brawn, Agility, Perception, Intelligence, Willpower, and Fellowship. Note that there are 9 options, and no attribute occurs more than twice. The character can choose 7 of these advances.
7. **Talents** - Each profession will have a list of talents that they can choose from. Each profession will have 6 talents available, though only 3 are chosen each tier. This allows for the profession to be taken twice without repeating talents.

## List of Professions for the Aspects of Eternity Setting
Professions are listed with some archetypal options. This list (and the lists of archetypes on each profession) may be incomplete at the moment and in need of expansion.

### Warrior Professions
These professions are focused on combat, and are generally the most combat-oriented professions in the game. They are among the professions most likely to have drawbacks.

- Proto-Vanguard
  - Archetypes: (Melee? / Ranged?)
  - Proto-Vanguard all super-soldiers who have been mutated by chaos and augmented by cybernetics. That said, each Proto-Vanguard is unique, and the archetypes listed above represent the greatest strength of the individual Vanguard. The Mutant is a Proto-Vanguard who has experienced stronger reactions to the chaos energies that flow through them and have gained innate (yet unstable) abilities. The Cyborg is a Proto-Vanguard who has embraced fully the benefits of cybernetics and has become a living machine. Their enhancements are often so extensive that even in biological death, they may continue with limited function.
- Auxiliary
  - Archetypes: Pathfinder, Warhammer
  - Auxiliary are special units put aside from the general command chain to perform special tasks. They are often put to use on tasks which could be frustrating or risky for general operatives, with the loss of an Auxiliary being considered relatively minor. The Pathfinder is a scout, sent to explore areas in which the threats and danger level are unknown and provide information so that the primary forces can move with greater confidence. The Warhammer is a mercenary with recognized value as an independent operator. They are sent to test the fighting strength of enemy forces and not to conquer territory.
- Soldier
  - Archetypes: Infantry, Heavy Weapons, Sniper
  - Soldiers are the backbone of any military force. They are the ones who do the fighting, and they are the ones who are expected to do the fighting. The Infantry are the standard foot soldiers, the ones who are expected to be everywhere and do everything. The Heavy Weapons are the ones who are expected to be in the thick of the fight, but who are also expected to be able to take a lot of punishment. The Sniper is the one who is expected to be able to take out the enemy from a distance, and who is expected to be able to do so with a high degree of accuracy.
- Shifter
  - Archetypes: Berserker, Warlock, Horror
  - Shifters are humans (or demihumans) who have been exposed to an unsustainable amount of chaotic mutation and somehow stabilized. They are able to shift between their human form and a more chaotic form. They focus on learning to utilize their chaotic nature, while resisting the urge to let it consume them. The Berserker is a Shifter who morphs into a monstrous form and fights with a brutal, savage ferocity. The Warlock is a Shifter who serves as a sort of conduit for the chaotic energies that flow through them and launch these energies as freeform projectiles which are not as focused as spells or psionics. The Horror is a Shifter who morphs into an abomination which the mortal mind struggles to comprehend. They play on fear and insanity, feasting upon the very minds of their enemies.
- Bounty Hunter
  - Archetypes: Detective, Retriever
  - Bounty Hunters are mercenaries who specialize in finding people and dealing with human threats. They may be required to capture, kill, or simply locate individuals that are otherwise out of reach of their employers. The Detective is a Bounty Hunter who specializes in hunting down criminals and bringing them to justice. The Retriever (or Corp Retriever) is a Bounty Hunter who specializes in recovering lost or stolen property. On the Overdark Station, Corp Retrievers are hired to recover gear loaned to (now dead) adventurers by corporate sponsors.

## Mystic Professions
These professions are focused on the use of chaos, in the form of psionics, magic, or both. They are corruptible and prone to uncontrollable outbursts of power. They are among the professions most likely to have drawbacks.

- Acolyte
  - Archetypes: Priest, Cultist
  - Acolytes are those who have dedicated themselves to the study of the a once divine entity in an age where the gods have fallen or died. While they cannot harness truly divine magick, with no patrons to grant them such power, their study of chaos is rooted in their faith and shaped by their devotion. The Priest is a member of a religious order who has dedicated themselves to the study of chaos. They are seen as the foremost experts on the subject and serve as leadership within their order. The Cultist is a secretive and sly individual who has dedicated themselves to a deity or other entity which is considered to be evil or otherwise dangerous. They mask their true nature and move with motives which are not always clear.
- Psion
  - Archetypes: Telekinetic, Alpha
  - Psions are those who have a natural affinity for chaos connected to their mind and soul. They are able to harness the energies of chaos and use them to perform a variety of effects. The Telekinetic is a Psion who is proficient in manipulating objects and energies with their mind. The Alpha is a Psion who is able to manipulate minds of lesser will, influence others, and exert complete control over many beasts and xenos.
- Wytch
  - Archetypes: Sorcerer, Alchemist
  - The Wytch is a practitioner of elder magick, the long forgotten methods by which beings of the old world once manipulated the energies of chaos. The Sorcerer is a Wytch who has learned to channel magick directly through their body, enabling more improvised and less ritualistic use of magick. The Alchemist is a Wytch who treats their use of magick as a science, and who has learned to create and manipulate substances which are not normally found in the world. They are most proficient in rituals and complex curses. Sorcerers and Alchemists both study and make use of spells in addition to their specialties.
