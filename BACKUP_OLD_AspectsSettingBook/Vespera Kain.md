# Dr. Vespera Kaine

## Background

Dr. Vespera Kaine is a brilliant and ambitious scientist, specializing in the fields of technomancy and the arcane. She is the first to discover the connection between technology and the ethereal winds, chaos, and all magicks. This groundbreaking revelation allowed her to create new forms of technomancy, including psychic control devices and swarms of mind-controlled micro-drones. Dr. Kaine is driven by a deep-rooted fear of an unknown cosmic event, which she believes will bring about the destruction of the world.

## Personality

Dr. Kaine is a determined and relentless individual, willing to cross moral and ethical boundaries to achieve her goals. Her fear of the impending cosmic catastrophe has warped her sense of right and wrong, leading her to commit atrocities such as enslaving skilled workers and putting countless lives at risk.

## Motivation

Dr. Kaine's primary motivation is to prevent the cosmic event she believes will destroy the world. To this end, she seeks to harness the power of a hidden relic within the Overdark Station, aiming to use it to control the entire station and its immense technological resources. She believes that by doing so, she will be able to defend the world against any threat, no matter how great.

## Plans

Dr. Kaine's plans involve locating and retrieving the ancient relic hidden within the Overdark Station, and using it to power her psychic control devices. She intends to gain control of the entire station and its technology, turning it into a formidable defense against the impending cosmic catastrophe. However, her actions unknowingly risk awakening an ancient, slumbering god within the station, which could bring about the very destruction she seeks to prevent.

## Story Arc

Dr. Vespera Kaine serves as the main antagonist for the first story arc of the campaign. The players will be hired by a corporation to explore the Overdark Station and retrieve valuable technology, eventually crossing paths with Dr. Kaine and her forces. As they delve deeper into the station, they will uncover the extent of her plans and the terrible consequences they could have for the entire world.

Throughout the arc, the players will face numerous challenges and confrontations with Dr. Kaine's followers, as well as her technomantic creations. They will need to navigate the treacherous and unpredictable environment of the Overdark Station, all while trying to piece together the mystery behind Dr. Kaine's true intentions and the ancient relic she seeks.

The climax of the story arc will involve the players confronting Dr. Kaine and attempting to stop her from unleashing the slumbering god within the station. The outcome of this confrontation, and the choices the players make along the way, will have lasting consequences for the future of the campaign and the world itself.
