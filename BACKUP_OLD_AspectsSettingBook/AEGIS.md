# AEGIS Shields

## Overview

AEGIS (Advanced Energy Guarding & Interception System) Shields are a revolutionary defensive technology that has had a significant impact on warfare and personal security in the world of Harbor. These energy-based shields, developed by the brilliant engineers of the Lords Eternal, provide an added layer of protection to those who can afford to wield them. AEGIS shields are highly sought after for their ability to absorb damage and regenerate over time, making them a valuable asset for soldiers, mercenaries, and adventurers alike.

## History

The origins of the AEGIS shields can be traced back to the early days of the Lords Eternal's rise to power. As the technological prowess of the Lords Eternal continued to advance, they sought ways to protect their forces in the field and ensure their dominance in battle. The development of the AEGIS technology marked a significant turning point in warfare, as it allowed the Lords Eternal to deploy their troops with a newfound level of confidence and security.

Initially, the AEGIS shields were reserved for the elite forces of the Lords Eternal, but over time, the technology began to trickle down to the general population. While the AEGIS shields used by the common folk may not be as advanced or powerful as those wielded by the Lords Eternal, they still offer a significant advantage in combat situations.

## Mechanics

AEGIS shields provide additional damage steps to the bearer's damage track, functioning as an extension of their Lightly Wounded step. The exact number of damage steps and regeneration rate varies depending on the specific model and quality of the AEGIS shield. Each shield has the following traits:

- Damage Threshold: The amount of damage the shield can absorb before its first step is crossed.
- Damage Steps: The number of wound steps the shield can take before attacks bypass it and damage the user.
- Recovery Rate: The speed at which the shield regenerates, listed in minutes and rounds (e.g., 1min:10 for 1 minute, 10 rounds or 1hr:600 for 1 hour, 600 rounds).
- Traits: Unique abilities or enhancements, such as Overcharge, Harmonize, and Siphon, which may vary between shields.
- Special Cases: Any specific damage types or environmental factors that affect the shield's performance, either positively or negatively.

## AEGIS Shield Traits

- Overcharge: Allows the user to spend an Action Point to temporarily increase the shield's Damage Threshold for a limited time.
- Harmonize: Grants the user the ability to synchronize their shield with an ally's AEGIS shield, combining their Damage Thresholds and Damage Steps.
- Siphon: Enables the user to absorb energy from incoming attacks, converting a portion of the damage into a temporary boost to their Damage Threshold.

## Conclusion

AEGIS shields have become an integral part of warfare and personal defense in the world of Harbor. The advanced technology behind these energy shields provides users with increased survivability, making them a valuable asset in combat situations. As the technology continues to evolve and become more widely available, AEGIS shields are likely to remain a prominent feature of the battlefield for the foreseeable future.

## Sample Shield: AEGIS Mark IV Personal Shield

| A.E.G.I.S. Mark IV Personal Shield |                                                               |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DTh                                | 12                                                            |
| DSt                                | 3                                                             |
| RR                                 | 20min:200                                                     |
| Traits                             | Reactive Overcharge, Harmonize, Energy Siphon                 |
| Special Cases                      | Vulnerability 4 (EMP, Ion), Environmental Resistance 2 (Cold) |

As you can see from the table above, the Aegis Mark IV Personal Shield provides a good balance of protection, regeneration, and additional abilities, making it a versatile choice.

### Explanations
- Reactive Overcharge: As a once per encounter ability, when the shield is depleted and the wearer would take damage, they can activate this ability to instantly recharge the shield to full, providing all 3 extra Lightly Wounded steps again. After using this ability, the shield's recovery rate is doubled for the remainder of the encounter.
- Harmonize: If the character has not taken damage for 5 rounds, the shield regenerates 1 Lightly Wounded step.
- Energy Siphon: Absorb 25% of incoming energy damage to recharge the shield more quickly. Reduce the recovery rate by 1 round for every 4 points of energy damage absorbed (up to a maximum of 25 rounds reduced).
- Vulnerability: The shield's Damage Threshold is reduced by 4 against EMP and ion damage, making it more susceptible to these types of attacks.
- Environmental Resistance: In low-temperature environments, the shield gains +2 Damage Threshold, making it more effective in these conditions.
