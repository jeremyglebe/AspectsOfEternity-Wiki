Would you expand the following talent and its short description into a full description?

[TALENT GOES HERE]

Here are some examples of full talent descriptions, so you can get an idea of what I'm looking for:


## Left-Handed Path

You possess an inexorable command over the powers of chaos and disorder and are resilient to their corrupting effects.

Effect: When you Channel Power, if your Chaos Dice do not result in a Chaos Manifestation, you avoid gaining Corruption as a result.

Short: Avoid Corruption when Channeling Power.

## Lightning Reaction

You are unnaturally fast and able to assess the situation with lightning reflexes.

Effect: In combat, you gain 1 additional Action Point. However, it can only be used to Dodge and Parry. This Action Point refreshes at the beginning of your Turn.

Short: +1 AP to Dodge and Parry.

## Indifference

You’ve grown accustomed to the battlefield and the smell of rotting corpses doesn’t bother you.

Effect: When viewing blood-soaked and visceral scenes of death, you always succeed at Resolve Tests to withstand their potential psychological effects (such as with Stress, Fear and Terror) and don’t suffer Corruption due to such scenes.

Short: Ignore Fear and Terror from blood and gore.

## Kidney Shot

A well-placed shot to the vitals will stagger your enemy.

Effect: You penalize your foe’s ability to Resist a Stunning Blow by a -10 Base Chance to their Skill Test. In addition, when you use a Stunning Blow, your foe loses 2 Action Points, instead of 1 Action Point.

Short: More powerful Stunning Blow.

## Light Sleeper

You rest with one eye open, ever-watchful for danger.

Effect: When you are sleeping, you cannot be Surprised or left Helpless.

Short: Cannot be Surprised while sleeping.

## Long-Winded

You can exert yourself above and beyond normal limits.

Effect: When you suffer physical Peril, reduce your Peril Condition Track by one less step negatively.

Short: Heal Peril when suffering physical Peril.

## Mine Craft

You have an aptitude for not getting lost below ground, using the flow of water and the marks upon rocks to find your way.

Effect: When beneath the earth, you gain a +20 Base Chance to Navigation Tests. In addition, you always know true north below ground, even in total darkness.

Short: +20 Navigation when underground.

## Overwhelming Force

When armed with a heavy weapon, you can deliver crushing blows that splinter shields and shatter weapons.

Effect: If you roll a Critical Success with a Melee Attack, you inflict the Ruined! Quality to a foe’s shield, weapon or armor (your choice). Overwhelming Force has no effect on Castleforged trappings, and you must be armed with a two-handed melee weapon.

Short: Ruin items on Critical.

## Run Amok

You plow through your enemies, driving the business end of your weapon home with terrible accuracy.

Effect: When you Charge, you gain a +20 Base Chance to strike with a melee-based Attack Actions and Perilous Stunts.

Short: +20 to melee Charge.
