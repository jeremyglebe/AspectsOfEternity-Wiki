Would you create a full description for the following profession for me?

PROFESSION_DESCRIPTION


Please follow each step below (Use information from the profession description where you can):
1. Create the name of the profession.
2. Create a trait for each archetype of the profession. Examples of traits are provided.
3. Create requirements for the profession. Requirements may be skill ranks, signature items, or even more abstract things like social status, languages, or education levels. Professions with skill-based requirements are expert professions and cannot be used by new characters. (Professions should only be made expert-level if they feel like a natural progression of other professions)
4. (Optionally) Create drawbacks for the profession. (These should affect actual game mechanics) Drawbacks are more prominent in combat-heavy or magickal professions.
5. Choose 10 skill upgrades for the profession. Some professions may list "Open" as one or more of the skill advancements. "Open" represents characters who have a lot of freedom in how they pursue their profession. To that end, an "Open" skill advancement allows a character to gain a rank in *any* skill they choose. Scouts, Pilots, and Scavengers are all examples of professions where someone might learn a variety of skills. Add "Open" as one of the skill upgrades if the profession does some "jack of all trades" work.
6. Choose 9 bonus advances for the profession. No attribute occurs more than twice.
7. Choose 6 talents for this profession. I will provide a list of talents with their short descriptions. You should choose 4-5 existing talents from the provided list, then create 1 or 2 new talents depending on how many existing talents you chose. (There will be 6 total)

FORMAT FOR YOUR OUTPUT

Please output the description as markdown code which is inside of a code block! (So that I can copy it to my wiki) Please match the format of the example profession as closely as possible! The profession should contain EXACTLY 10 skills, 9 bonus advances, 6 talents.


EXAMPLE PROFESSION
Please try to match the style the abilities take on. Just giving combat bonuses in different situations, even to combat heavy classes, can feel very generic and boring. Skill progressions in combat makes the character feel like a fighter, but talents and traits should feel unique and provide an advantage not otherwise seen. (Some combat advantages may make for good traits, but only if they are very unique, such as slayers having an extra fury die of damage against creatures they've faced before)

# Bounty Hunter

Bounty Hunters are mercenaries who specialize in finding people and dealing with human threats. They may be required to capture, kill, or simply locate individuals that are otherwise out of reach of their employers. There are two main archetypes for Bounty Hunters: Detective and Retriever.

## Requirements

Experience as a law enforcement officer, private investigator, or freelance mercenary is typical.

### Equipment Requirements

Melee Weapon, Ranged Weapon, Surveillance Gear, Restraints

## Starting Equipment (if Basic Tier)

Knife, Baton, Semi-Automatic Pistol, Bullet (x9), Surveillance Gear, Restraints, Leather Armor, Tracking Device (x3), First Aid Kit, Rations (x10), Lock-picking Kit, Nav System

## Archetypes

### Detective

The Detective is a Bounty Hunter who specializes in hunting down criminals and bringing them to justice. They often work directly with law enforcement, though they may operate independently in the case of a vendetta. In private business, they may help locate or monitor people of interest to their employers.

#### Underworld Tracker

As a seasoned Detective, you have a deep understanding of the criminal underworld and know how to navigate its intricate web to hunt down your targets. Your expertise allows you to uncover hidden leads and track criminals more effectively.

Effect: When attempting to gather information or locate a target, you gain a +10 Base Chance to all relevant Rumor and Skulduggery checks. Additionally, once per session, you can tap into your network of informants to gain a valuable clue or piece of information related to your current target, as determined by the GM.

### Retriever

The Retriever is a Bounty Hunter who specializes in recovering lost or stolen property. On the Overdark Station, Corp Retrievers are hired to recover gear loaned to (now dead) adventurers by corporate sponsors. They are somewhat notorious for producing corpses to recover gear from.

#### Gadget Savant

As a Retriever, you have extensive experience with various adventuring gadgets and travel gear. Your expertise allows you to make the most out of advanced equipment and quickly identify potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities.

Effect: When using advanced equipment or attempting to exploit weaknesses in such gear, you gain a +10 Base Chance to relevant Tradecraft, Skulduggery, and Ranged Combat checks. Additionally, once per session, you can gain a temporary advantage or bypass a security feature on a piece of high-tech equipment, as determined by the GM.

## Drawbacks

### (Retriever) Public Disdain

As a Retriever, you're known for tracking down and recovering stolen goods or fugitives, which has garnered you a negative reputation among the general public. Many people view you as a ruthless enforcer for the powerful or greedy, rather than a protector of justice.

Effect: You suffer a -10 to your Base Chance for social skills such as Charm, Bargain, or Guile when interacting with civilians. Additionally, the disposition of civilian NPCs during Social Intrigue encounters related to your work is always Unfriendly.

### (Detective) Relentless Pursuit

Your pursuit of the truth gnaws at you, and losing potential sources of information before you've solved a case is unacceptable. This unyielding dedication can lead to unintended consequences when your target is slain before all relevant information is extracted.

Effect: You suffer Corruption if you kill a target related to your investigation without obtaining all vital information from them (as determined by the GM). Additionally, you gain Corruption if you kill a target you were meant to apprehend, even if the violent encounter was unavoidable.
