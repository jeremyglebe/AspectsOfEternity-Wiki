## The Return to Eden

After the God-Emperor's passing and the issuance of his final command to return to Eden, Eldric Stargazer joined the other Lords Eternal in leading Humanity on a perilous journey back to their ancestral home. Upon arriving at Eden, he played a crucial role in the establishment of Harbor, the last bastion of Humanity, and dedicated himself to its protection and prosperity.

## Leadership in Harbor

As the Lord of Harbor, Eldric Stargazer has devoted his life to defending the city against the relentless onslaught of demonic forces and the dangers of Eden's hostile environment. Despite the limitations of his Hallowed Armor, which are slowly losing their energy, he remains a powerful and inspiring figure in the fight for Humanity's survival.

Under his leadership, the city of Harbor has grown and adapted, with its citizens developing a deep sense of unity and determination. Eldric's wisdom and guidance have been instrumental in navigating the complex political landscape of Harbor, ensuring stability and harmony among the various factions that make up the city's population.

Despite his immense power and responsibilities, he is often seen engaging with ordinary citizens, offering his assistance and support in their daily struggles. His dedication to the welfare of his people has only served to strengthen the bonds between the Lord of Harbor and those he protects.

The people of Harbor look to Eldric as a beacon of light, a true embodiment of the God-Emperor's will, and a testament to the indomitable spirit of Humanity.

## Addiction to Starfire

Eldric initially began using the [Starfire Elixir](Starfire%20Elixir.md) as a means to cope with the immense pressure of his duties and the constant threat of the demonic forces encroaching upon Harbor. Over time, he found himself relying on the elixir more and more, ultimately succumbing to its addictive properties.

While he has managed to keep his dependency a secret from the public, a small circle of his closest confidants is aware of his struggle. They do their best to support him and help manage his addiction, recognizing the importance of his leadership and the burden he carries as the Lord of Harbor.

However, his dependency on the elixir has made him vulnerable to those who control the supply of the substance, granting them significant influence over a man. Though he is of a generally benevolent nature, his enormous power combined with such leverage makes for a volatile situation. This adds a layer of tension and intrigue to the politics and power dynamics within Harbor, as well as an additional challenge for Eldric Stargazer himself to overcome.

<summary>Sermon entitled <i>Stargazer The Mighty</i></summary>

> Brothers and sisters, gather 'round and let me recount the tale of our Savior, His Majesty, the Lord of Harbor, who once again demonstrated his unwavering devotion to the people of this fair city.

> In the darkest hours of our struggle against the abyssal scourge, our valiant soldiers were besieged by a monstrous horde of demons, their blood-curdling cries echoing across the battlefield. The demonic tide seemed insurmountable, and our brave defenders found themselves pushed to the brink of annihilation.

> But in that moment of despair, the heavens opened and revealed the shining figure of our Savior, His Majesty the Lord of Harbor. With a fierce determination in his eyes, he descended upon the battlefield, his Hallowed Armor aglow with divine energy.

> As the demons closed in, His Majesty activated his Hallowed Armor for a mere eleven seconds. And in that fleeting instant, the world was bathed in a blinding light, as if the God-Emperor himself had descended to deliver his wrath upon the enemy.

> The ground shook, and the air trembled as the Lord of Harbor unleashed a devastating wave of divine power, annihilating the demonic horde in the blink of an eye. The remnants of the infernal host scattered before the might of our Savior, and the soldiers of Harbor found themselves bathed in the warm, protective embrace of his strength.

> His Majesty's Hallowed Armor, now drained of their precious energy, fell silent once more. But the Lord of Harbor had accomplished his mission, saving our people from certain doom and driving back the abyssal terrors that sought to consume us all.

> So let us give thanks to our Savior, His Majesty the Lord of Harbor, for his selfless sacrifice and unwavering devotion to the people of this city. In the name of the God-Emperor, we offer our deepest gratitude and pledge our eternal loyalty to the noble cause of defending Humanity against the darkness that threatens to engulf us all. Amen.
