<summary>Aspects of Eternity Talents</summary>

## Arc Lightning

Effect: When casting a spell which inflicts lightning damage, you may spend an additional AP to arc your lightning to all characters adjacent to the target. This counts as a single attack. Roll damage in an identical manner to the original spell. Each defender resists with a Coordination or Toughness test. On failure, they take the full damage while ignoring 1 point of their armor value. On critical failure, they take double damage while ignoring 2 points of their armor value. On success, the defender does not take damage. On critical success, each character adjacent to the defender automatically succeeds their test as well. When arc lightning is used repeatedly in one turn, targets cannot be struck by the arc lightning multiple times, and you can only spread lightning from one additional target for each AP spent. This attack is subject  to the multi-attack rules.
