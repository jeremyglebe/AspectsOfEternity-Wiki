# Ideas Not Yet Assigned to a Table

1. Alien virus/parasite that infects corpses of dead raiders, turning them into zombie-like creatures. The raiders are still partially in control of their actions, but are driven by a desire to kill and infect others. (They scream for help, but the only thing they can do is attack.)
2. Raiders who are living on the station permanently now. They feed on mutants and other raiders and refuse to ever return to the ground.
3. Cultists who worship the Overdark Station and its creators. They believe that the station is a gift from the gods, and that the station's creators are the gods themselves. (They have gone insane from their time on the station)
4. "The Growth" is a giant, hive mind mutant that takes the form of a vast network of plant life on the ground. It's origins lie in the station and the Player Characters stumble upon the lab where it was tested.
