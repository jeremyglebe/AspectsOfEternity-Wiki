Certainly! While I may not have access to all of the rules for Zweihander, I can still create a rough draft for the Proto-Vanguard profession based on your description. Here's a starting point for you to develop further and tailor to the specific rules and mechanics of the game:

Proto-Vanguard Profession
Primary Attribute: Combat

Profession Traits:

Mutagenic Resilience: As a result of their mutations, Proto-Vanguards have a heightened resistance to physical harm. They gain a bonus to their Toughness attribute, making them more resilient in combat.

Enhanced Reflexes: The mutagens coursing through their veins grant Proto-Vanguards increased agility and reaction speed. They gain a bonus to their Agility attribute, allowing them to act and react faster in combat situations.

Volatile Mutation: While the Proto-Vanguard's mutations grant them powerful abilities, they also come with a cost. Whenever they suffer a critical hit or fail a challenging combat-related skill check, they must roll on the Volatile Mutation table to determine a random side effect that occurs. These side effects could range from temporary debuffs to their attributes or skills, to more severe consequences that require immediate attention.

Martial Prowess: The rigorous training and martial techniques passed down from the Astral Vanguard make the Proto-Vanguards skilled warriors. They gain a bonus to their Melee or Ranged attack skill, depending on their chosen specialization.

Indomitable Will: The weight of their role and the side effects of their mutations have forged Proto-Vanguards into mental fortresses. They gain a bonus to their Willpower attribute, making them less susceptible to fear and mental manipulation.

Drawbacks:

Mutagen Dependency: Proto-Vanguards require regular doses of specialized mutagens to maintain their abilities and stave off the worst side effects of their mutations. They must track their supply of mutagens and ensure they do not run out, or risk suffering debilitating withdrawal symptoms that can hinder them in and out of combat.

Outsider Status: As members of an experimental fighting force, Proto-Vanguards are often viewed with a mixture of admiration and suspicion by the citizens of Harbor. They may face social challenges, prejudice, or even outright hostility from certain factions within the city.

This rough draft should give you a starting point to develop the Proto-Vanguard profession further, customizing it to fit the rules and mechanics of Zweihander and the unique lore of your world.
