# Tech Levels

Tech levels represent the complexity and sophistication of weapons and armor in the setting. They range from primitive, low-tech equipment to mysterious and incomprehensible relics. The tech level of a character's equipment is influenced by their skills in Warfare and Xenoscience. Understanding how tech levels work is crucial for both players and game masters.

## Weapon and Armor Tech Levels

1. **Primitive**: Low-tech, simple weapons and armor. Examples include clubs, spears, and hide armor. Also includes early firearms and other pre-industrial weapons. Unarmored defense and unarmed attacks are also tech level 1, unless specified otherwise in a trait, talent, etc.
2. **Standard**: Conventional modern-day or near-future weapons and armor. Examples include firearms, melee weapons made from advanced materials, and ballistic vests.
3. **Advanced**: High-tech weapons and armor from advanced civilizations. Examples include energy weapons, powered exoskeletons, and adaptive camouflage.
4. **Alien or Chaos**: Exotic, otherworldly, or chaotic weapons and armor with strange and unpredictable properties.
5. **Relic**: Mysterious and ancient items, often a mix of alien and chaotic influences. They are not used by any living civilization, and their full functionality may be impossible to comprehend.

## Proficiency with Tech Levels

A character's maximum weapon/armor tech level is determined by the following chart:

| Skill Ranks Required         | Maximum Weapon/Armor Tech Level |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| None                         | 1                               |
| Warfare (1)                  | 2                               |
| Warfare (2)                  | 3                               |
| Warfare (2), Xenoscience (1) | 4                               |
| Warfare (1), Xenoscience (2) | 4                               |
| Warfare (3), Xenoscience (1) | 5                               |
| Warfare (2), Xenoscience (2) | 5                               |

This means that a character's maximum tech level can range from 1 to 5.

### Using Weapons and Armor Above Your Proficiency

Attempting to use equipment above your maximum tech level results in penalties:

#### Weapons

- 1 tech level higher: The wielder flips-to-fail all combat tests.
- 2 tech levels higher: The wielder fails all combat tests.
- 3 tech levels higher: The wielder critically fails all combat tests.
- 4 tech levels higher: The wielder critically fails all combat tests. Additional penalties apply circumstantially at the GM's discretion.

#### Armor

- 1 tech level higher: The armor's encumbrance is multiplied by 2. The armor value is halved.
- 2 tech levels higher: The armor's encumbrance is multiplied by 2. The armor value is 0. The wearer flips-to-fail all coordination tests.
- 3 tech levels higher: The armor's encumbrance is multiplied by 3. The armor value is 0. The wearer automatically fails all coordination tests.
- 4 tech levels higher: The armor's encumbrance is multiplied by 3. The armor value is 0. The wearer automatically critically fails all coordination tests. Additional penalties apply circumstantially at the GM's discretion.

## Interaction of Different Tech Levels in Combat

### Higher Tech Level Weapon vs. Lower Tech Level Armor

- 1 higher: Damage from the weapon's fury die ignores armor value.
- 2 higher: Damage from attacks with the weapon ignore armor entirely.
- 3 higher: Damage from attacks with the weapon ignore the armor value and deal +1D6 fury dice in damage. The defender must roll a (Challenging -10%) Coordination test each time they are hit with the weapon. On failure, the armor is ruined. On critical failure, the armor is ruined and the defender automatically suffers an injury (in addition to any rolled injuries). On critical success, the defender may automatically succeed on the next Coordination test of this kind against that weapon.
- 4 higher: Damage from attacks with the weapon ignore the armor value and deal +2D6 fury dice in damage. The defender must roll a (Hard -20%) Coordination test each time they are hit with the weapon. On failure, the armor is ruined. On critical failure, the armor is ruined and the defender automatically suffers an injury (in addition to any rolled injuries). On critical success, the defender may automatically succeed on the next Coordination test of this kind against that weapon.

### Lower Tech Level Weapon vs. Higher Tech Level Armor

- 1 lower: The weapon does not add fury dice to its damage.
- 2 lower: The weapon does not inflict damage.
- 3 lower: The attacker must roll a Coordination test each time they hit the defender with the weapon. On failure, the weapon is ruined. On critical failure, the weapon ruined and attacker falls prone. On critical success, the attacker may automatically succeed on the next Coordination test of this kind against that armor.
- 4 lower: Same as above, except all failures are considered critical failures, successes are considered failures, and critical successes are considered successes.

## Summary

Tech levels are an important aspect of the game, representing the complexity and sophistication of weapons and armor. Characters' proficiency with tech levels is determined by their ranks in Warfare and Xenoscience skills. Higher tech level weapons provide advantages against lower tech level armor, while lower tech level weapons struggle against higher tech level armor. Penalties apply when attempting to use weapons and armor above a character's proficiency. Understanding and applying tech levels in gameplay ensures a balanced and engaging experience for both players and game masters.
