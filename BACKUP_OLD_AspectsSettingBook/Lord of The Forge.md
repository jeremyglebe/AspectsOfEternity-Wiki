# The Lord of The Forge

## Overview

The Lord of The Forge is one of the six remaining Lords Eternal, known for his mastery of both technology and the secrets of mutagens. His primary focus is to ensure the safety of humanity on Eden, but he is haunted by the lost knowledge of the past, and he tirelessly works to rediscover that knowledge to further the cause of humanity. He is the lead scientist among the Lords Eternal and the creator of the Proto-Vanguard, an experimental fighting force designed to replicate the powers and capabilities of the Astral Vanguard.

## Ancient Blueprint

The Lord of The Forge discovers a hidden archive containing a blueprint of a powerful ancient weapon or technology, lost during the 50,000-year war. He becomes obsessed with recovering all the necessary components and recreating this ancient marvel, believing it could significantly bolster humanity's defenses. However, to complete the project, he must embark on a dangerous quest to gather the rare materials and knowledge needed to finish the weapon.

## Rival Faction

A rival faction emerges, led by another scientist who once studied under the Lord of The Forge. This faction believes that the Proto-Vanguard project is misguided and potentially dangerous to humanity, as they are creating unstable warriors. The Lord of The Forge must deal with the political and ethical implications of his work while defending his project against this rival faction's attacks, both physical and ideological.

## A Hidden Truth

The Lord of The Forge uncovers a dark secret about the God-Emperor's death and the nature of the Astral Vanguard's dwindling numbers. This revelation could shake the foundations of the Lords Eternal and their leadership over humanity. The Lord of The Forge must decide whether to share this knowledge with his fellow Lords, risking the stability of their rule, or to keep the secret hidden, potentially at the cost of his own conscience.

## Personal Redemption

The Lord of The Forge harbors a deep sense of guilt for the lives lost and the suffering caused by his experiments with mutagens. He embarks on a personal journey to atone for his past, seeking out those affected by his work and attempting to make amends. Along the way, he encounters individuals and situations that challenge his beliefs and force him to confront the true cost of his research.

## The Emergence of New Powers

As the Lord of The Forge continues his research, he stumbles upon a new type of mutagen or technology that has the potential to unlock untapped powers in humans. This discovery could revolutionize humanity's abilities and defenses, but at the same time, it could also introduce new, unforeseen dangers. The Lord of The Forge must weigh the benefits against the risks and determine if this new discovery should be shared with the rest of humanity or kept hidden to prevent potential abuse or catastrophe.
