# Savage Worlds Adventure Edition: Templates

Templates in SWADE are used to represent the areas affected by various actions in the game, such as explosions, area spells, and breath weapons. They are typically categorized into two types: Blast Templates and Cone Templates. 

## Blast Templates

Blast Templates represent the effect of explosions or other area-based attacks. These are used for targeting a location rather than individual entities and, therefore, bypass specific defensive bonuses of the targets within the template, such as the Dodge Edge or speed penalties.

Blast Templates come in three sizes:

- Small: 4 yards in diameter, typically affecting 2 targets.
- Medium: 8 yards in diameter, usually affecting 3 targets.
- Large: 12 yards in diameter, generally affecting 4 targets.

## Cone Templates

A Cone Template represents the spread of certain area effects, such as dragon's breath or a flamethrower's blast. The small end of the template emanates from the attacker. Successful attacks hit all entities beneath the template.

The standard Cone Template is an 18-yard-long cone that typically affects 3 targets.

## Area Effect Attacks

When using area effect attacks, defensive bonuses for specific targets covered by the template, such as the Dodge Edge or speed penalties, are ignored. To attack with a template, the player places the template on the tabletop (or describes where they want it to land) and rolls the appropriate skill. Any target even partially beneath the template is affected, regardless of any attack penalties to hit.

## Deviation

Should an attack with a Cone Template fail, it might still affect the area around it but won't have any game effect on characters or other targets. 

Blast Templates that miss deviate 1d6" for thrown weapons (like grenades) and 2d6" for fired projectiles, with the distance multiplying based on the range. The direction of deviation is determined by rolling a d12 and reading it like a clock face. An attack cannot deviate more than half the distance to the original target.

## Cover & Area Effect Attacks

Solid obstacles like trees or brick walls can provide protection against area effect attacks. The damage is reduced by the amount listed on the Cover Bonus table under Cover & Obstacles if they are between the origin of the blast and the target, and the GM reasonably thinks they'd apply.

## Percentage Cone Templates

In addition to the standard templates, you can use Percentage Cone Templates for more nuanced control over the affected area. These templates allow you to use a certain percentage of the standard Cone Template's length. 

For instance, a 50% Cone Template would only cover half the distance of the standard Cone Template (9 yards), and a 25% Cone Template would cover a quarter of the distance (4.5 yards). This allows for the representation of effects that don't reach as far as those covered by the full Cone Template.

These new Percentage Cone Templates offer flexibility and precision, adding an extra layer of strategy to your Savage Worlds games.

## Template Images

Images of the standard templates are available in the SWADE Core Rules. These images can be printed out and used at the table for easy reference during gameplay.
